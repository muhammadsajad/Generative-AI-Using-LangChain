# Generative-AI-Using-LangChain

ðŸ“š I'm learning Generative AI using LangChain.  
This repository contains my practice code and experiments with different models from:

- OpenAI  
- Hugging Face  
- Anthropic  
- and more  

I'm exploring how to build applications with LLMs using LangChain's powerful tools.

ðŸ§  Topics I'm covering:

- Prompting with LLMs  
- Chaining LLMs  
- Using external tools like APIs and memory  
- Integrating various providers with LangChain  

ðŸ“º **Special thanks to [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/@CampusX) YouTube channel**  
Iâ€™m learning a lot from their tutorials. Their content is helping me understand Generative AI better.

Feel free to follow my learning journey!
