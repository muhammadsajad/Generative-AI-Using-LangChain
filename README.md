# Generative-AI-Using-LangChain

ðŸ“š I'm learning Generative AI using LangChain.  
This repository contains my practice code and experiments with different models from:
- OpenAI  
- Hugging Face  
- Anthropic  
- and more

I'm exploring how to build applications with LLMs using LangChain's powerful tools.

ðŸ§  Topics I'm covering:
- Prompting with LLMs
- Chaining LLMs
- Using external tools like APIs and memory
- Integrating various providers with LangChain

Feel free to follow my learning journey!
